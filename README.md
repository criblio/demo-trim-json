# demo-trim-json

This is the trim-json pack that's used in the cribl-demo environment. It has been moved here to facilitate install via git repo and eliminate a build step.

# Why is this not in the Cribl Dispensary

The Dispensary is curated packs for customer use. The packs in the cribl-demo are specifically built for show. There is an effort planned to use the dispensary packs instead of demo versions (like the pan firewall pack, specifically), but until that's done, we'll maintain all of these as separate repos.
